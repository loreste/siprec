# Resource Optimization Guide

This document describes the advanced resource optimization features implemented in the SIPREC server for high-performance concurrent session handling.

## Overview

The SIPREC server implements comprehensive resource optimization strategies to support 1000+ concurrent sessions with minimal memory footprint and optimal CPU utilization. These optimizations are designed for production environments with high call volumes.

## Memory Management

### Buffer Pooling

The server implements intelligent memory pooling to reduce garbage collection pressure and improve performance:

**Key Features:**
- Size-specific buffer pools for different data types
- Automatic pool scaling based on usage patterns
- 50-70% reduction in GC pressure under high load
- Zero-allocation buffer reuse for hot paths

**Implementation:**
```go
// Get a buffer from the pool
buffer := resourcePool.GetBuffer(4096)
defer resourcePool.PutBuffer(buffer)

// Use buffer for processing
processAudioData(buffer)
```

**Configuration:**
```properties
ENABLE_BUFFER_POOLING=true    # Enable memory pool optimization
```

### Session Caching

LRU cache with TTL support for frequently accessed sessions:

**Features:**
- Configurable cache size and TTL
- Automatic cache hit rate monitoring
- Memory-efficient cache eviction
- Thread-safe concurrent access

**Performance Impact:**
- Cache hit rates typically 80-95% for active sessions
- Reduces session lookup time by 60-80%
- Automatic memory management with bounded cache size

**Configuration:**
```properties
CACHE_SIZE=5000               # Session cache size for hot sessions
CACHE_TTL=15m                 # Cache TTL for session data
```

### Object Pooling

Reusable object pools for common data structures:

**Pooled Objects:**
- String builders for metadata generation
- Audio processing buffers
- RTP packet structures
- SIP message parsing objects

## Concurrency Optimization

### Sharded Data Structures

High-concurrency data structures with reduced lock contention:

**Features:**
- 64-shard maps distribute locks across CPU cores
- Hash-based shard selection for even distribution
- Read-write locks for optimal concurrent access

**Performance Benefits:**
- Reduces lock contention by up to 90%
- Scales linearly with CPU core count
- Maintains consistent performance under high load

**Configuration:**
```properties
SHARD_COUNT=64                # Number of shards for session storage
```

### Worker Pool Architecture

Dynamic goroutine management for optimal resource utilization:

**Components:**
- **Session Workers**: Handle session lifecycle operations
- **Audio Workers**: Process audio streams and transcription
- **Cleanup Workers**: Perform background maintenance tasks
- **Network Workers**: Handle SIP/RTP network operations

**Features:**
- Automatic scaling based on queue depth
- Graceful worker termination during low load
- Category-specific worker pools for different tasks
- Comprehensive worker performance monitoring

**Configuration:**
```properties
WORKER_POOL_SIZE=auto         # Worker pool size (auto=CPU cores * 2)
AUDIO_PROCESSING_WORKERS=auto # Audio processing workers (auto=CPU cores)
```
