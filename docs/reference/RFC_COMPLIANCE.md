# RFC Compliance Documentation

This document details how the SIPREC server implementation adheres to the relevant SIP and SIPREC RFCs.

## Supported RFCs

The server implements the following RFCs:

### RFC 6341 - Basic Session Recording Protocol

This RFC defines the session recording metadata model for SIP.

#### Implementation Details:

- **Metadata Structure**: The `RecordingSession` and related structs include all required fields from RFC 6341
- **Participant Information**: Complete participant metadata including roles, identifiers, and streams
- **Security Mechanisms**: Certificate and identity handling for recording entities
- **Extended Metadata**: Support for additional metadata fields defined in the standard

### RFC 7245 - Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format

This RFC defines the mechanisms for session continuity in SIP-based communications.

#### Implementation Details:

- **Dialog Replication**: Full implementation of dialog replication for recovery
- **Replaces Header**: Complete support for SIP Replaces header mechanism
- **Session Recovery**: Method for recovering sessions after network failures
- **Failover IDs**: Consistent failover ID handling across session transitions

### RFC 7865 - Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata

This RFC defines the metadata format for SIP-based recording sessions.

#### Implementation Details:

- **Metadata Format**: Implementing the rs-metadata+xml format
- **SDP Handling**: Proper SDP negotiation for recording sessions
- **Recording Controls**: Start, stop, pause capabilities for recordings
- **Participant Structure**: Correct modeling of participants in recordings

### RFC 7866 - Session Recording Protocol

This RFC defines the protocol operations for establishing, maintaining, and terminating recording sessions.

#### Implementation Details:

- **SIP Call Flows**: Implementation of required SIP message sequences
- **Recording Session Establishment**: Protocol for initiating recording sessions
- **Media Stream Handling**: Management of media streams in accordance with the spec
- **Notification Mechanisms**: Implementation of state change notifications

## Key Components

The implementation consists of several key components that work together to ensure RFC compliance:

### 1. SIP Layer (pkg/sip)

The SIP layer handles:
- SIP dialog management
- Transaction processing
- State maintenance
- Protocol operations

### 2. SIPREC Layer (pkg/siprec)

The SIPREC layer provides:
- SIPREC metadata generation and parsing
- Session recording association
- Participant management
- Stream identification

### 3. Session Redundancy (pkg/siprec/session.go)

The redundancy implementation ensures:
- Session state persistence across failures
- Dialog recovery mechanisms
- Media stream continuity
- Replaces header handling

## Deviation Notes

While the implementation aims for full compliance, there are a few areas where it deviates from or extends beyond the RFCs:

1. **Storage Backend**: The RFC does not specify a storage mechanism for session state. Our implementation provides a pluggable storage backend with an in-memory default.

2. **Expiration Handling**: We've implemented more aggressive session expiration monitoring than required by the RFCs to improve resource management.

3. **Extensions**: Additional metadata fields beyond the RFC requirements are supported for enhanced functionality.

## Testing and Verification

Compliance with the RFCs has been verified through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Tests for each component to verify correct behavior
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Full flow tests that simulate real-world scenarios
3. **RFC Test Cases**: Implementation of the test cases described in the RFCs

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to improve RFC compliance:

1. **Distributed Storage**: Support for Redis and other distributed storage systems
2. **TLS for Signaling**: Enhanced TLS support for secure signaling
3. **SRTP for Media**: Full SRTP implementation for secure media transport
4. **Additional Event Notifications**: Enhanced event notification mechanisms
