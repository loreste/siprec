# SIPREC Server Migration Notes

This document outlines the migration of the SIPREC server codebase from a flat structure to a modular package-based architecture.

## Migration Status

The codebase has been successfully migrated from a monolithic flat structure to a modular package-based architecture. This migration improves code organization, testability, and maintainability.

## Current Structure

```
/
├── cmd/                  # Command-line applications
│   ├── siprec/           # Main server application
│   └── testenv/          # Environment testing utility
├── pkg/                  # Reusable packages
│   ├── messaging/        # Message queue integration
│   ├── media/            # RTP/media handling
│   ├── sip/              # SIP protocol handlers
│   ├── siprec/           # SIPREC protocol implementation
│   ├── stt/              # Speech-to-text providers
│   └── util/             # Utility functions and configuration
├── test/                 # Test utilities
└── scripts/              # Maintenance scripts
```

## Legacy Files

All the core functionality has been migrated to the new modular structure. The old files have been removed and replaced with a cleaner separation of concerns.

## Migration Plan (Completed)

1. ✅ Create modular package structure
2. ✅ Migrate configuration management to `pkg/util`
3. ✅ Migrate speech-to-text providers to `pkg/stt`
4. ✅ Migrate AMQP integration to `pkg/messaging`
5. ✅ Create unified entry point in `cmd/siprec`
6. ✅ Migrate SIP protocol handlers to `pkg/sip`
7. ✅ Migrate RTP handling to `pkg/media`
8. ✅ Migrate SIPREC protocol to `pkg/siprec`
9. ✅ Add comprehensive tests

## Future Work

While the code structure migration is complete, there are still some improvements that can be made:

1. ✅ Add unit tests for key packages
2. ✅ Add end-to-end tests for the complete system
3. Expand test coverage for all packages
4. Implement proper metrics collection and reporting
5. Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Add proper documentation to all exported functions
7. Consider adding OpenAPI documentation for the HTTP endpoints

## Building and Running

During the migration period, the application can be built and run using:

```bash
# Build
go build -o siprec-server ./cmd/siprec

# Run
./siprec-server
```

Or using the Makefile:

```bash
make build
make run
```
