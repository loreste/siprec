# SIPREC Production Readiness Improvements

The following improvements have been made to ensure the SIPREC implementation is production-ready:

## Enhanced Validation
- Added comprehensive SIPREC message validation that checks all required RFC fields
- Added robust validation of participant information and AOR URIs
- Added stream validation for mixed streams
- Implemented validation of state transitions to prevent invalid state changes
- Added proper role and stream type validation

## Improved Error Handling
- Implemented structured error reporting with error codes and context
- Added proper error propagation throughout the SIPREC implementation
- Added specific error responses for different error conditions
- Enhanced error response to include proper RFC-compliant reason references
- Implemented validation of critical metadata before processing

## Session Management
- Added proper session tracking with timestamps for creation and updates
- Implemented session expiration management
- Added resource cleanup for terminated sessions
- Enhanced session state change handling with proper validation
- Added error state tracking to detect and recover from issues

## RFC Compliance
- Added support for RFC 7866 requirements for SIPREC session management
- Added proper handling of failover scenarios (RFC 7245)
- Implemented proper MIME formatting for multipart messages
- Added required participant information in all SIPREC responses
- Enhanced stream handling for mixed and individual streams

## Resource Management
- Implemented session cleanup for terminated sessions
- Added tracking of resource usage and proper release
- Enhanced port allocation and deallocation
- Added goroutine-based cleanup to prevent blocking on termination

## Monitoring and Debugging
- Added timestamp tracking for debugging session timing issues
- Enhanced logging for session state changes
- Added error tracking counters for monitoring session health
- Added validation warnings to detect potential issues early

## Production Metrics
- Added fields for tracking error rates and retries
- Added support for logical resource IDs for load balancing
- Implemented session timeout management
- Added tracking of source IP addresses for security and diagnostics
- Added support for callbacks to integrate with external monitoring systems
