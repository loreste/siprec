# TLS and SRTP Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the TLS and SRTP implementation in the SIPREC server.

## TLS Implementation

The TLS implementation enables secure SIP signaling by:

1. Configuring the SIP server to listen on a dedicated TLS port (default 5063)
2. Using X.509 certificates for server identity verification
3. Enforcing TLS 1.2+ for security

The implementation uses the sipgo library's `ListenAndServeTLS` method with the correct "tls" network type. Key changes include:

- Using separate goroutines for each listener type (UDP, TCP, TLS)
- Proper error handling and propagation from listener threads
- Port verification to ensure the TLS server is correctly bound

### Configuration

TLS is configured in the `.env` file with:

```
ENABLE_TLS=true
TLS_PORT=5063
TLS_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
TLS_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.pem
```

## SRTP Implementation

SRTP (Secure RTP) implementation enables secure media transport by:

1. Adding SRTP support to RTP forwarders
2. Generating secure crypto attributes in SDP
3. Implementing proper SRTP packet processing

Key components include:

- `SRTPKeyInfo` struct for managing crypto attributes
- Updates to media handling for secure packet processing
- SDP generation with crypto attributes

### Configuration

SRTP is enabled in the `.env` file with:

```
ENABLE_SRTP=true
```

## Testing

End-to-end testing was performed using:

1. A standalone TLS test client/server
2. OpenSSL client for TLS verification
3. SIP OPTIONS requests over TLS

Key testing outcomes:

- TLS server successfully starts and binds to configured port
- Client connections over TLS work correctly
- SIP responses are properly generated
- Connection security is maintained

## Next Steps

1. Further testing with real SIP clients that support TLS/SRTP
2. Performance testing under load
3. Certificate rotation and management
4. SRTP key rotation implementation
