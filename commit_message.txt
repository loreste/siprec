Implement TLS and SRTP support

This commit adds comprehensive support for secure communications in the SIPREC server:

1. TLS for SIP signaling:
   - Implement proper certificate validation
   - Run TLS server on port 5061
   - Configure with modern TLS settings (TLS 1.2+)

2. SRTP for media encryption:
   - Fix syntax errors in SRTP packet processing
   - Implement proper SSRC extraction and handling
   - Add robust error recovery mechanisms

3. SDP enhancements for SRTP:
   - Add SRTPKeyInfo struct for crypto attributes
   - Update SDP generation to include SRTP info
   - Support RTP/SAVP protocol for secure media

The implementation follows RFC 3711 for SRTP and RFC 4568 for SDP security descriptions.
